# Predicting-House-Prices-in-Python
Using Linear Regression and Decision Tree Algorithms to predict house prices
# Project 1: House Price Predictor : Project Overview
* Applied the Machine Laerning Algorithms : Linear Regression and Decision Tree Regression to predict House prices 
* After Exploratory Data Analysis, feature engineering is done to extract useful features to improve the accuracy of the model
* Significant features are used to train the linear regression model, and the best model is selected accordingly.
* Hyperparameter tunning is done on Decision Tree Regressor to find optimal parameters for the model using RandomSearchCV
* Optimal parameters are used to reach the best Decision Tree Reressor model
* Out of two selected models of Linear Regression and of Decision Tree Regreesor, the best performing model is found to be of a Decision Tree Regressor.
