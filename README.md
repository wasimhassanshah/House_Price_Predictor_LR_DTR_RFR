# Predicting-House-Prices-in-Python-LR-DTR-RFR-XGboostR
Using Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, Random Forest Regressor, and XGboost Regressor Algorithms to predict house prices
# Project 1: House Price Predictor : Project Overview
* Applied the Machine Laerning Algorithms : Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regression, Random Forest Regressor, and XGboost Regressor to predict House prices 
* After Exploratory Data Analysis, feature engineering is done to extract useful features to improve the accuracy of the model
* Significant features through Forward feature Selection are used to train the linear regression model, and the best model is selected accordingly.
* Hyperparameter tunning is done on Decision Tree Regressor, Random Forest Regressor, and XGboost Regressor to find optimal parameters for the model using RandomSearchCV
* Optimal parameters are used to reach the best Random Forest Regressor model
* Out of four , the best performing model is found to be of a XG boost Regressor.
