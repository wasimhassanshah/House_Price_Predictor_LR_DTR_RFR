# Predicting-House-Prices-in-Python-LR-DTR-RFR
Using Linear Regression and Decision Tree Regressor and Random Forest Regressor Algorithms to predict house prices
# Project 1: House Price Predictor : Project Overview
* Applied the Machine Laerning Algorithms : Linear Regression and Decision Tree Regression and Random Forest Regressor to predict House prices 
* After Exploratory Data Analysis, feature engineering is done to extract useful features to improve the accuracy of the model
* Significant features through Forward feature Selection are used to train the linear regression model, and the best model is selected accordingly.
* Hyperparameter tunning is done on Decision Tree Regressor and Random Forest Regressor to find optimal parameters for the model using RandomSearchCV
* Optimal parameters are used to reach the best Random Forest Regressor model
* Out of tthree , the best performing model is found to be of a Random Forest Regressor.
